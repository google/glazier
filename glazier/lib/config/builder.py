"""Manages the initial processing of build.yaml files.

## Overview

The Config Builder is responsible for compiling a custom installation task list
for the local host.  It traces through all yaml configuration files linked to
the root config, and stores any commands that are determined applicable by
pinning (or lack thereof).

The end result of running ConfigBuilder is a single ordered list of tasks to
be performed when installing the host.

## Use

Start is the main entry point for the class.  It expects a path to a
configuration directory and a filename (the base build.yaml).

## Include Logic

Yaml files can refer to one another via the include directive.  Each sub-yaml
is treated identically to the base file, following the exact same logic.  The
include directive calls Start on each included file, completing that file
top-to-bottom before returning to the caller.

BuildInfo tracks our position in the directory tree.  Additional levels
(includes in sub-directories) are pushed onto the ActiveConfigPath while we
process the include.  At the end of processing the stack is popped, returning us
to our previous level.  This allows us to reference other files relative to the
location of the active config.
